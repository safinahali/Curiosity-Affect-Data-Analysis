# Curiosity-Affect-Data-Analysis

## Curiosity times visualization

Used the processing script for visualizing the types of curiosity against time. This script is for P01, replace with other participants' data  in the script for the others. 

## Affdex graphs 

Affdex graphs are inside the numbers file - this is also affdex values for P-01. 

To do the correlations preview, simply overlap the graphs obtained from the JS and numbers. Also, you can set up the numbers graphs as a background in the sketch_171207a.js file (uncomment that line), but it's tricky with the edges.
